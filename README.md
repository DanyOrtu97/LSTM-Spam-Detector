# LSTM-Spam-Detector
Spam Detector using RNN network for classification of spam and ham
---


## Note

A commented version of the code can be found in the jupyter notebook file (SpamDetector.ipynb)

## Prerequisites 
---

#### 1 Create a project folder
Open a new terminal tab on your ubuntu machine and type:
```
mkdir SpamDetector
cd SpamDetector
```

#### 2 Clone the project's repo

On the same SpamDetector folder 

```
git clone https://github.com/DanyOrtu97/LSTM-Spam-Detector.git
```

#### 3 Install requirements

```
cd LSTM-Spam-Detector
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


#### 4 Run the project

```
python3 SpamDetector.py
```

#### NOTE
On "Test_Hyperparameters_results" you can find:
  - our scripts for model testing with hyperparameters (including plots and plotting code)
  - our scripts for different neural network models
  - our scripts for classic ML algorithms (like KNN, Random forest, SVM, Naive Bayes and Binary classifier)
